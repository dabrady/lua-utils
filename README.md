# lua-utils
A collection of utilities I've built as-needed for progamming in Lua and working with [Hammerspoon](hammerspoon.org).

Utilities compatible with vanilla Lua 5.3 are at the top level, while those intended for working with and/or extending Hammerspoon core libraries are nested within the `hs` directory.
